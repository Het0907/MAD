# This is a placeholder for sound files
# In a real application, you would add actual sound files here:

# Example sound files that could be added:
# - click.mp3 (button click sound)
# - correct.mp3 (correct answer sound)
# - wrong.mp3 (wrong answer sound)
# - success.mp3 (quiz completion sound)
# - letter_sounds/ (folder with individual letter sounds)
# - number_sounds/ (folder with individual number sounds)

# For now, we're using text-to-speech for audio output
# To add custom sounds, place audio files here and update audio_service.dart
